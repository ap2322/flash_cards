##  Flash Cards

This is an edited version of the Flash Cards project. This project works through four iterations that starts with creating basic classes of Card, Turn, Deck, and Round and then adds a runner file to play a trivia game through the terminal. The last iteration introduces adding a text file to a Card Generator class so different trivia questions can be imported instead of hardcoded.

This version was forked from the starter repository for the [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project.
